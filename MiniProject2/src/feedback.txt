The main obsticles were to make the concurrency properly. We spent quite a bit of time refactoring and optimizing the 
parallel and concurrent implementation. For example initially we did the solution with Threads only, however we then
decided to use tasks and the Executor framework to make our system a lot more resource friendly and responsive. Other
than that the task was quite simple (our implementation is 150 lines of code) and easy to implement when it comes to logic as
there are numerous ways to make this work.
